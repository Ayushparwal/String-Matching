# String Matching Algorithm Using Rapidfuzz and fuzzywuzzy python lib.

This project visualizes the string matching algorithm for given Two address based upon the dataset I have used and after that I have build UI with Tkinter.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- python-Levenshtein

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ayushparwal/String-Matching.git
    ```

## Usage

Run the application with the following command:
```sh
python stringMatchingUI.py <grid_type>
```
- <grid_type>: 'default' or 'empty'

Example:
```sh
python main.py default
```

The Fuzzy Score is a measure used to quantify how similar two strings are. It is typically calculated using algorithms that allow for approximate string matching, which is especially useful when the strings have small differences such as typos, abbreviations, or variations in capitalization.

The Jaccard Score (or Jaccard Similarity) is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. It is commonly used to measure the similarity between two sets based on the ratio of their intersection to their union.
